  TWN Site
</h1>

This project is being built to showcase my development skills in creating a template for a business website.  Using GatsbyJS's default starter, my intention is to create a better flow for building webpages, from the bottom up.  

## Step 1: Create a basic Mobile First design
My first step for building this site is to add a design framework.  I am using MaterialUI for this project.

## Step 2: Configure Data
This step is to make sure my data is stored and accessed in one place.  I am using GraphQL for this part of the project.
